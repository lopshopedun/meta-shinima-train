OpenEmbedded/Yocto custom layer for Shinima-train project
=========================================================

"Shinima-train" is project for chinese high speed railways where train's radio relays are switching between ground stations located on towers along the way of the train.

The word "Shinima" is taken from the Internet meme "Shinima Hue Nyong" to emphasize the originality and my attitude to this project, and also that the name "china*-train*" has already been used several times in local discussions.

This layer provides custom recipes of debug/release libraries and packages for use with OpenEmbedded
and/or Yocto.
